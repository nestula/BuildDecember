            <p>Our goal is simple: to build the most <strong>comprehensive, easy-to-use, and feature-packed build planner</strong> for Undecember. We're constantly working behind the scenes to improve the planner, adding new features, improving calculations, and making sure it's everything you need to take your builds to the next level.</p>
            
            <h2>Community-Driven Development</h2>
            <p>This project is powered by <strong>you</strong>â€”the players! We truly believe that the best tools come from the community, and that's why we <strong>value your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.</strong> Every bit of input helps us make the planner better and more useful for everyone.</p>
            
            <p>Your voice <strong>shapes the future</strong> of this tool, and we're here to listen.
